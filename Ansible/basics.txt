Ansibl - fiction communication device, that can send information faster than light speed. 
It was used in some books for remote steering of many spaceships in the same time.

Ansible - configuration management:
-installation software packages
-making/changing configuration files
-changing permissions
-starting/restarting services
on many servers at once.

Installation:
pip install ansible

ansible --version   #checking version

Server provisioning - running new instances of vms. 
Deployment orchestration - making operatios in dedicated order on many remote servers. 

Ansible by default use ssh client installed on host, python Paramiko module may be used too.

Playbook (scenariusz) - .yml file, script writed in yaml (list of dictionaries) with instructions to do for servers. 
Can be written in JSON format too. It`s agentless and use push method to send instructions.
Ansible is connetcting with given hosts by SSH simultaneously and check the state of given instructions, if its already done, shows 'ok'. 
If they are not done, will do them (idempotention) in described order and change status for 'changed'. Will not start operatation until last one is not done. 
Ansible is using python and simplejson library, so it must be installed on servers.

Playbok - [on server] - Action - Task - Module

ansible-playbook playbook.yml   #running the playbook
--start-at-task [NAME]          #will run playbook at given task (located by name)
--list-tasks                    #show tasks that playbook includes
--check                         #will run playbook in check mode (simulating changes); in tasks: 'check mode: yes'
--diff                          #used with check will show changes that will be made on server - installed packages etc; in tasks: 'diff: yes'

Modules are scripts installed with ansible to do given operations (file/dir creation, copying, installing).

Ansible modules (apt, yum) are made for specific linux distibutions. 
Ansible use roles and variables may be used in playbooks.

Modules:
ansible [HOST_ALIAS] -m command -a [ARGS]                   # command module lets using bash command on server
ansible testserver -m command -a uptime
ansible testserver -a uptime                                # command is a default module, you can give only command as argument

  vars:                                                                     #vars , eg. {{ cert_file }}  will search for cert_file in vars section and paste it while running 
          key_file: /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key                                #in older ansible version $ was used instead {{ }}
          cert_file: /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt
          conf_file: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
          server_name: localhost
  tasks:                                                                    #things to do (hosts and task element are obligatory), one action with few tasks

    - name: Kopiowanie klucza TLS
      copy: src=files/nginx.key dest={{ key_file }} owner=root mode=600     #copy module will copy file from host to remote server
      notify: Restart Nginx   
    - name: Kopiowanie certyfikatu TLS
      copy: src=files/nginx.crt dest={{ cert_file }} 
      notify: Restart Nginx                                                 #notify: [handler_name] (powiadom), is sended to handler when ansible returns 'changed' in given task
    - name: Kopiowanie pliku konfiguracyjnego Nginx 
      template: src=templates/nginx.conf.j2 dest={{ conf_file }}            #this module creates files from template and copy it to server
      notify: Restart Nginx
    - name: Konfiguracja
      file: dest=/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default src={{ conf_file }} state=link
      notify: Restart Nginx
    - name: Kopiowanie index.html
      template: src=templates/index.html.j2 dest=/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html mode=0644
  handlers:                                                                 #handlers means procedures - just if statements (conditional instructions)
    - name: Restart Nginx                                                   #like task, but it is runing only when another task send notification to handler
      service: name=nginx state=restarted                                   #service module can manage linux services (start/stop/restart)

In this case ansible will restart nginx (hander Restart Nginx) every time when task that include 'notify' instruction is runned (changed its state).
Handlers are definied only once at the end of playbook.They are mostly used to restart services or servers.

TAGS:
Plays in playook may be marked by tags to divide separate parts of playbook.
Tags can be used in tasks too: installation, configuration etc.

- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - common
    - apache2
  tags: web_tag        #inline with hosts, roles etc; name, apt in tasks

- hosts: proxy
  become: yes
  roles:
    - common
    - nginx
  tags: proxy_tag
    
ansible-playbook [PLAYBOOK_FILE] --list-tags          #list tags from playbook
ansible-playbook [PLAYBOOK_FILE] --tags [TAG_NAME]    #run playbook, but only tasks from given tag 
                                                      #running multiple tags: '--tags tag1,tag2' (will run all tasks from tags) WITHOUT SPACE!!!

tags: always    #this tag is always running no matter of given tag
