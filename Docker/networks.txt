Networks types:
-bridge -isolated (from host) network for containers
-host -network for containers without isolation (host IP)
-overlay -for docker Swarm (more than one daemons), communication between container without routing
-MacVLAN -mac for container (looks like phisical device in network)
-None -no networking

Host Network
docker run --network=host [IMAGE]:[TAG]            #Connecting created cotainer to host network - all ports the same as host
_________________________________________________________________________

Docker network:
Docker is using bridge interface that connects docker0 virtual interface with phisical host interface. 
Docker0 is using private subnet (free from host), contoainers get IPs from tis private subnet and can communicate each other. 
Incoming traffic must be routed by proxy service. 

Docker has internal DNS service (disabled in docker0). Containers run with the same (added) network can communicate using their names.

docker network ls                            #Listing docker networks
docker network inspect [NET_NAME/ID]         #Show info about network

docker network create [NETWORK_NAME]                     #Creating new docker network
docker run -it --network=[NETWORK_NAME] [IMAGE]:[TAG]    #Creating container connected to given network


docker run --network=none [IMEGE]:[TAG]            #Creating container without network (secure option)

Overlay - networks between many docker server demons.
