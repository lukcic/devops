Cloud Deveopment Kit - SDK for creating AWS apps (from resources). 

By default use TypeScript and translate commands to other programming languages using JSii.
Resources written in CDK are transferred to AWS CloudFormation do deploy as real IaaC infrastructure (synthesation). 


Installation:   
npm install -g aws-cdk
cdk --version

AWS CDK Demonstration 

mkdir CDKPrimer
cd CDKPrimer

cdk init --language typescript      #initialize your AWS CDK project by running the init command in the terminal.

npm install @aws-cdk/aws-ec2 @aws-cdk/aws-ecs @aws-cdk/aws-ecs-patterns     #Install the AWS Construct Library modules for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon ECS

Open the file cdk-primer-stack.ts in the /lib directory. Add the following Amazon ECS and Amazon EC2 AWS Construct Library module imports to the cdk-primer-stack.ts file.

import * as ec2 from "@aws-cdk/aws-ec2";
import * as ecs from "@aws-cdk/aws-ecs";
import * as ecs_patterns from "@aws-cdk/aws-ecs-patterns";

Under the comment that indicates where stack resources are included, add these lines of code, and then save the cdk-primer-stack.ts file:

    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, "MyVpc", {maxAzs: 2});

    const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, "MyCluster", {vpc: vpc});

      new ecs_patterns.ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService(this, "MyFargateService", {

          cluster: cluster,

          taskImageOptions: { image: ecs.ContainerImage.fromRegistry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample") },

          publicLoadBalancer: true

  });

cdk synth   #Synthesize the code into an AWS CloudFormation template using the the cdk synth command. Synthesized templates are located within the cdk.out directory. 

cdk deploy  #Deploy the stack. Log in to the AWS Management Console and search for CloudFormation. Choose CdkPrimerStack, and then select Resources to view the deployed resources.

cdk destroy #To remove all resources created in the stack, run the following command in the terminal:
