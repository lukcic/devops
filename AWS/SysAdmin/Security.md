# DDoS

Services used to protect:
* Shield Standard - free, activated for everyone (3,4 layer attacks)\
* Shield Advanced - paid ($3000) 24/7 premium, response team, higher fees pays AWS
* WAF - filter specific requests based on rules
* CloudFront and Route53 - availability protection by using global edge network
* ASG - be ready to scaling

Architecture:
Users --- Route53 (with Shield) --- CloudFront (with Shield) + WAF --- ELB in public network (with Shield) --- ASG (in private network)

# WAF

# Trusted Advisor (doradca)

High level account recommendations. Weekly email notification.

Analyze your AWS account - works on defined checks (passed or not)

Trusted advisor is based on AWS support plans.

Basic and developer support plan (7 checks):
* Cost optimization
    * instances low utilization, idle load balancers, under-utilized EBS
    * reserved instances and saving plans optimizations
* performance
    * high utilized instances, CloudFront optimizations
    * EC2 to EBS throughput optimizations, alias records recommendations
* security
    * MFA on root account, IAM key rotation, public exposed access keys
    * S3 bucket permissions for public access, security groups with unrestricted ports
* fault tolerance
    * EBS snapshots age, Availability Zone balance
    * ASG Multi-AZ, RDS Multi-AZ, ELB configuration
* service limits

Business and enterprise Support plan:
* full check based on all 5 categories
* set CloudWatch alarms when limits reached
* AWS support API (programmatic access)

# Encryption


# Key Management Service (KMS)

>CloudTrail, Glacier and Storage Gateway are encrypted by default!

Keys types:
* symetric (AES-256)
    * single key to encrypt/decrypt
    * used by AWS services integrated with KMS
    * cannot access unencrypted key - must call KMS API to use

* asymtric (RSA & ECC key pairs)
    * public key to encrypt and private key to decrypt
    * used to sign/verify
    * public key is downloadable, but cannot access private key in unencrypted form
    * use-case:  encryption outside AWS, by users who can't call the KMS API

KMS keys:
* AWS managed keys (free): aws/rds, aws/ebsâ€¦
* Customer managed keys created in KMS ($1 per key)
* Customer managed keys imported ($1 per key): must be 256-bit symetric
* Custom key stores HSM (expensive)

Pricing: $0.03 per 10 000 calls

>The same KMS key cannot live in 2 different regions.
For copying EBS volume encrypted with KMS, encrypted snapshot must be created, then snapshot after copying will be re-encrypted with different key from target region (AWS will handle this).

>EBS volume encryption key cannot be changed - create new volume using snapshots and specify the new KMS key.

### Key rotation
* AWS-managed KMS keys: automatic rotation every 1 year
* Customer-managed KMS keys: automatic rotation every 1 year (must be enabled)
* Imported KMS key: only manual rotation using alias

#### Automatic key rotation
* always for 1 year
* previous key is kept to decrypting old data
* new key has the same ID (only key is changed)

#### Manual key rotation
* when you want rotate keys more often than once a year
* new key has different ID
* keep the previous keys active, so you can decrypt old data
* better to use aliases in this case (to hide the key ID changes)

### KMS key deletion
* deletion can be scheduled with a waiting period of 7 - 30 days
* during `pending deletion` status key can't be used for any cryptographic operations, key is not rotated even if was planned
* deletion during waiting period can be cancelled
* when key in pending deletion is tried to use, you can specify notification (CloudTrail, CloudWatch Alarms, SNS) using metric filter `in pending deletion`

### KMS key policies

Control access to KMS keys like S3 bucket policies:
* Default KMS Key policy
    * created if ou don't provide own KMS key policy
    * complete access to the key to the root user = entire AWS account

* Custom KMS key policy
    * define users or roles that can access the KMS key
    * define who can administer the key
    * useful for cross-account access to the kys

>Copying Snapshots across accounts:
>* create a snapshot encrypted with won KMS key (customer managed)
>* attach a KMS Key policy to authorize cross-account access
>* share the encrypted snapshot
>* Create a copy of the Snapshot (in target), encrypt it with a CMK in your account.

Example of encrypting/decrypting file using AWS keys (with API calls):

```bash
# 1) encryption
aws kms encrypt --key-id alias/tutorial --plaintext fileb://ExampleSecretFile.txt --output text --query CiphertextBlob  --region eu-west-2 > ExampleSecretFileEncrypted.base64

# base64 decode for Linux or Mac OS
cat ExampleSecretFileEncrypted.base64 | base64 --decode > ExampleSecretFileEncrypted

# 2) decryption

aws kms decrypt --ciphertext-blob fileb://ExampleSecretFileEncrypted   --output text --query Plaintext > ExampleFileDecrypted.base64  --region eu-west-2

# base64 decode for Linux or Mac OS
cat ExampleFileDecrypted.base64 | base64 --decode > ExampleFileDecrypted.txt
```
### Hardware Security Module (CloudHSM)
AWS provision dedicated encryption hardware, we are managing keys entirely.
Supports both symetric and asymetric keys. HMS clusters are spread across Multi AZ (HA).

# AWS Artifact

On-demand access to AWS compliance documentation and agreements.
For audit and compliance.

# ACM - AWS Certificate Manager

Provision, manage ad deploy SSL/TlS certificates.
Supports private and public certificates.
Free of charge for public TLS certificates.
Automatic certificate renewal.

Integration:
* ELB
* CF Distribution
* APIs on the API gateway

# Secrets Manager

Capability to force rotation of secrets every X days.
Automate generation of secrets (using Lambda).
Secrets rotation events details are registered in CloudTrail. Combined with CloudWatch Alarms gives possibility to notify users.
Strong integration with RDS (MySQL, PostrgreSQL, Aurora) for storing credentials.
Secrets are encrypted using KSM.

Pricing:
* 30 days trial demo
* $0.40 per secret per month
* $0.05 per 10,000 API calls

### Differences between Parameter Store:
* simple API
* no parameter rotation
* KMS encryption is optional
* Parameter Store has CloudFormation integration
* can pull secret (from Secret Manager) using the SSM Parameter Store API
