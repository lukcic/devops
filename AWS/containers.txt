Container Orchestration:
-how to manage running containers?
-how much resources on host are still available?
-on which host schedule next container?
-are containers crashed or running?
-how to restart crashed containers?
-How to remove unused replicas?

ECS - Elastic Container Service
ECS cluster - contain all services
ECS use ec2 instances connected to ECS cluster by container runtime and ECS agent (control plane communication). 
Still need to manage virtula machines:
-ec2 must be created manually and joind to ECS cluster
-you have to check if there are free resources before deploying new container
-manage OS
-full access to your infrastructure!

ECS Fargate (serverless):
-manage containers
-manage virtual machines (hosts) infrastructure too (no need to create them)

ECS with Fargate:
-no need to provision and manage virtual machines
-all on demand
-runs only as much resources as you need
-you pay only for needed resources
-elastic (scale up and down)

EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service

-alternative to ECS
-compatilbe with open source Kubernetes (same K8s API)

EKS cluster - control plane (K8s master) are deployed and managed by EKS.
Master nodes and ecds are replicated across Availability Zones.
Compute fleet - worker nodes. 

EKS with EC2 - you have to manage infrastructure to worer nodes. 
EKS with nodegroup - will creates manage EC2 instances, but must be confiured.
EKS with Fargate - fully managed worker nodes and control plane.

Repository for container images, alternatve to DockerHub or Nexus.
